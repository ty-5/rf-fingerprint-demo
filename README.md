# Demo Web Application

> **Interactive demonstration of our RF fingerprinting model achieving 98% accuracy with perfect distance invariance**

## Demo Objectives

This web application demonstrates our trained RF fingerprinting model in action, proving that our AI can accurately identify radio frequency devices by analyzing raw signal data rather than metadata or filenames.

## What We're Demonstrating

### **Core Capability Proof**
- **98% accurate device classification** from raw RF signal data
- **Perfect distance invariance** - accuracy unchanged across power levels
- **Real signal analysis** - model reads actual I/Q data, not file information
- **16 transmitter identification** from ORACLE dataset

### **Visual Evidence**
- **Step-by-step model analysis** showing feature extraction in real-time
- **Signal visualization** displaying actual I/Q waveforms being processed
- **Interactive confidence building** from 0% to 98% as features are detected
- **Feature highlighting** showing which signal patterns identify each device
